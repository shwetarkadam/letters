## Command line utility or browser app to write to it to here

*5 February,2022, Saturday @ 2:04pm*

I was thinking about using GitHub mobile app to edit to this file here instead of using the mobile browser all the time.
But found out I can't edit files on the mobile app.Now that's a shame.

So the idea to write some small command line utility which writes to this file or some kind PWA which writes to this file would be good.


## Audio blog feature on my [blog](www.codeklutz.com)

Need to add speech to text feature on my blog.
I found a old software which gives me decent audio on UK accent but need to copy paste the text ,generate audio and add the same in the local and push it.I need to find a way to automate this.
PowerAutomate desktop in windows seems like a good option but isn't free for normies ,only students and professionals.Could also dabble within desktop testing tools.


## FAT-Find Among us Tabs web extension.

*5 February, 2022, Friday at 4:29am*

Most of the times at work during hunting among a lot of confluence docs tabs I tend to get a little lost in navigating back to the tab in which I wanted to go .  

So a cross browser extension which finds text among all tabs and highlight that particular tab so navigation could be easier.

I was thinking of chrome extension before but since I switched to mozilla,cross browser extension would be ideal.

It could have a simple UI taking some input but that input keyword needs to be searched across all tabs within a window (different windows not sure if it's possible yet) and highlight maybe the top tab part.Also searching the tab within the tab titles.
