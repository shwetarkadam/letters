## FAT-Find Among us Tabs web extension.

*February 5, 2022 at 4:29am*

Most of the times at work during hunting among a lot of confluence docs tabs I tend to get a little lost in navigating back to the tab in which I wanted to go .  

So a cross browser extension which finds text among all tabs and highlight that particular tab so navigation could be easier.I was thinking of chrome extension before but since I switched to mozilla,cross browser extension would be ideal.
It could have a simple UI taking some input but that input keyword needs to be searched across all tabs within a window (different windows not sure if it's possible yet) and highlight maybe the top tab part.Also searching the tab within the tab titles.
